# docker-demo

Welcome to the Team Check My GitHub Docker Demo. In this repository I will run
you through the introductory steps necessary to:

1. Set up Docker on your computer.
2. Use Docker to instantiate a Docker Container, using the Dockerfile contained
   in this repository.
3. Set up a development environment that interacts directly with the Docker
   Container, without having to rebuild it after every source change.

### Installing Docker

 Navigate to Docker's
[Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) web page, and
download Docker CS for Mac, Windows, or the Linux distribution of your choice.
Follow its installation process to completion.

### Setting up Your Docker Container

Once you have Docker, download this repository. Navigate into the directory,
and execute:

```bash
$ docker init
```
