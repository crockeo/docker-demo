        What does it mean?
      </h3>

      <p>
        If you're seeing this page, it means a couple of things are happening on
        your computer! First, you have Docker installed! Congratulations! Second,
        you have launched this application with docker-compose, well done!

        All of this was done without installing Node or MySQL onto your host
        computer, and can be done across platforms!
      </p>

      <h3>
        What to do from here?

      <p>Pay attention to the freakin' presentation, ya bozo.</p>
